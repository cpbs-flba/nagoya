# Nagoya Protocol
## Access to genetic resources and benefit sharing

According to the Nagoya Protocol (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_Protocol">Wikipedia</a>) when genetic resources are bought (for example tomatoa seeds) the data of the buyer and seller (or sender and receiver) has to be stored for 30 years.

This project can be used to set up a platform, that enables users to conduct transactions and store the relevant data in a blockchain (BigChainDB).

## Prototype
We are currently working on a prototype. As soon as it will be ready, we will publish the link here.

## Supported Use-Cases
* User management (user registration, login, logout, password recovery)
* Managing and exploring genetic resources (support for private, grouped and public resources)
* Creating contracts for genetic resources (incl. e-mail notifications, contract confirmation)
* Exploring contracts in the blockchain

## Used Technologies
The project was programmed in the latest open-source technologies
* Front-end: Angular 7
* Back-end: Java 11, Jetty, PostgreSQL, BigChainDB
